This app should have users vote between two kittens shown on the screen and give the total number of votes that they have recieved. Pictures are from imgur on the internet. Currently images do not hide after pressing button to vote again.

The approach to this app was to do the html, css, then the javascript. With the html, I chose the 960 12 column grid for simplicity. The css was styled to give a background color and a border to give the pictures that come up feel clickable. The javascript started with generating the random pictures to each choice. Then creating a button to allow new images to populate.
